======

Local search algorithm to solve clique parition problem.

This is the implementation of algorithm CPP-P3 in paper  "A three-phased local search approach for the clique partitioning problem"
http://www.info.univ-angers.fr/pub/hao/papers/ZhouHaoGoeffonJOCO2015.pdf

After compile the algorithm, you can use the following command to start the program:
usage: cpp -f <filepath> [-s <cut off time>] [-a <alpha>] [-b <beta>] [-t <tabu tenure base>] [-r <run time>]\n

The default parameters are setting according to the paper.
